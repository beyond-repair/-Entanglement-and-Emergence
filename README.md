# -Entanglement-and-Emergence
ðŸŒŒ **"Entanglement and Emergence"** explores spacetime and gravity as emergent phenomena from quantum entanglement. Using tensor network renormalization, this framework derives Einstein-like gravity with testable deviations:
- **Modified gravitational lensing** in entanglement-depleted regions.  
- **Quantum corrections to black hole entropy**.  
- **Pre-geometric phase transitions** imprinted in cosmological signals.  

Includes protocols for tabletop quantum simulations, astrophysical tests, and a roadmap to extend the 1D model to 3+1D. A bridge between quantum information theory, holography, and observable physics.  

ðŸ”— *Code, derivations, and simulations to test the paradigm are hosted here. Feedback and collaborations welcome!*
